Nothing to say more

It will not work because you don't have this driver (https://developer.samsung.com/android-usb-driver) it's (Samsung Android USB Driver for Windows v1.9.0.0 (35.5mb) | Apr10,2025)

Then you can connect your phone with a cable to the PC
Sadly for my Galaxy A55 5G I got "Something went wrong" while I wanted to try out the project on it, can't tell what did go wrong
